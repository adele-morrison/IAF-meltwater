# Plan for looking at propagation of shelf variability into the abyss

## Overview

Let's do something.

Overall Aim: How does variability on Antractic Shelves project into the abyssal ocean? In other words, how sensistive is the abyssal ocean to property changes on the shelf?

Why do we care: Abyssal water formed around Antractica  takes up 40% of ocean and drives lower cell of overturning. Important for many reasons. That abyssal source water is formed at only 4 sites around Antractica. 

Gap: We do not actually know how (specifically, how fast and how much) the signals of change at the surface propogate into the deep ocean.


## Possible Pitfalls and Ways to Overcome/Justify Them

The current model run does not have relaistic freshwater forcing -> if we think about relative changes or from a mechanistic point of view, this lack of forcing is not so important. AS LONG AS, we do not expect the freshwater forcing the change the dyanmics on the shelf (e.g. stratification). KG thinks this may be a pitfall

The length of the simulation may restrict how far north we can look (i.e. it takes longer to propogate further northwards).

We need to show that the model provides a reasonable scale of variability in both the shelf and abyss regions. Therefore, we need to compare with observations. `Lots' of mooring data in Weddell on shelf and in abyss. Ross Sea has Italien mooring G, Sarah Purkey work further downstream (AAB and Pacific). 

## Possible Analyses Figures

Pertubation Experiments (beyond what we want to do at the moment I think).

Hoevmollers: show you if signal propogate from some location to another location. Suggestions of building on Christina's work of DSW on the shelf and transport across 1000 m. Would still need to look further into the abyss I think?

Calculate time series of property, averaged over some region, and compare a shelf with the abyssal ocean: Figure would be a Simple Correlation (with Lag) of time series on the shelf and time series in the abyss? Or EOF patterns, if we think in 2D.

Look at extreme years at each location. For example, take the saltiest and freshest years on the shelf and average them - what do they look like, what is their difference, and how does that compare to the same 'extreme averages' downstream?
