# Plan for looking at propagation of shelf variability into the abyss

## Overview

Let's do something.

Overall Aim: How does variability on Antractic Shelves project into the abyssal ocean? In other words, how sensistive is the abyssal ocean to property changes on the shelf?

Why do we care: Abyssal water formed around Antractica  takes up 40% of ocean and drives lower cell of overturning. Important for many reasons. That abyssal source water is formed at only 4 sites around Antractica. 

Gap: We do not actually know how (specifically, how fast and how much) the signals of change at the surface propogate into the deep ocean.

## Possible Analyses

Pertubation Experiments (beyond what we want to do at the moment I think).

## Possible Pitfalls and Ways to Overcome Them 

## Figures

Hoevmollers: show you if signal propogate from some location to another location. Suggestions of building on Christina's work of DSW on the shelf and transport across 1000 m. Would still need to look further into the abyss I think?
