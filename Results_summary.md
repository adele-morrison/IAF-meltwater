# Overview of results

## Forcing perturbation

Describe the meltwater perturbation that was applied.

## Simulation responses

  * The added meltwater is [offset by 30% by the salinity restoring](https://github.com/adele157/IAF-meltwater/issues/2#issuecomment-1247471580), and a further [30% by increased sea ice growth](https://github.com/adele157/IAF-meltwater/issues/18#issuecomment-1247496210). Neither of these responses would be expected in the real world.

* Describe T/S changes in meltwater perturbation compared with obs time series.
